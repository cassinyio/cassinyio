## Pull Requests

Know how to fix something? We love pull requests! Here's a quick guide:

1. [Check for open issues](https://github.com/cassinyio/cassinyio/issues), or
   open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug.
   Opening a separate issue to discuss the change is less important for smaller
   changes, as the discussion can be done in the pull request.
2. Fork the relevant repository on GitHub, and start making your changes.
3. Check out the README for the project for information specific to that
   repository.
3. Push the change (we recommend using a separate branch for your feature).
4. Open a pull request.
5. We try to merge and deploy changes as soon as possible, or at least leave
   some feedback, but if you haven't heard back from us after a couple of days,
   feel free to leave a comment on the pull request.
